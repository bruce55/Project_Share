Project Share
======
This is a 60%-80% functional project made in 12 hours during **HackSH 1** which aims at sharing resources with others.

The new laundry policy next semester will provide each student free laundry once a week. This may not be enough for somebody. So do you want to share your laundry coin with others?

This project is developed to be a common sharing platform, which allows students to find peers to buy take-out food, do group study and more.
